## Configuration

You can specify configuration in a .toml file, or via environment variables or a combination of both.

Configuration values specified via environment variables should be prefixed with `INFUMAP_` and are case insensitive. Values specified in this way will override those in the settings file. You can specify that configuration should be exclusively taken from environment variables by setting the `INFUMAP_ENV_ONLY` environment variable to `true`. In this case, no `settings.toml` file will not be loaded or auto-created.

For documentation on each of the properties, refer to comments in the auto-generated `settings.toml` file, or [the template file](../infumap/default_settings.toml) in the source tree from which this is derived.
